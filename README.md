Terminal Command Classification using NLP & RNN
Just wrapped up a cybersecurity + AI project where I built an intelligent system to classify Linux terminal commands as Safe, Suspicious, or Malicious!
🔍 What I Built:
🧠 Used spaCy for NLP to preprocess and analyze attacker-style commands
📊 Trained an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) with TensorFlow to learn command behavior
🛡️ Detected threats like:
wget, curl → Malware download
rm, shred → Log deletion
sudo, passwd → Privilege escalation
🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python | spaCy | TensorFlow | Pandas | Matplotlib

Grateful for all the learning during this journey. Open to feedback and suggestions from the community!
